# Real Time Facial Expression Recognition System
Facial expression recognition is the task of classifying the expressions on face images into various categories such as anger, fear, surprise, sadness, happiness and so on.

In this project we are presenting the real time facial expression recognition of seven most basic human expressions: ANGER, DISGUST, FEAR, HAPPY, NEUTRAL SAD, SURPRISE. The system automatically detects face using HAAR cascade then its crops it and resize the image to a specific size and give it to the model for prediction.

Practical Use Cases of Facial Emotion Detection Using Artificial Intelligence-

1. Making Cars Safer and Personalized - Facial Emotion Detection can find subtle changes in facial micro-expressions that precedes drowsiness and send personalized alerts to the driver asking him to stop for a coffee break, change music or temperature.
2. Facial Emotion Detection in Interviews - With Facial Emotion Detection technology, a recruiter will be able to know, say, the overall confidence level of an interviewee and make a decision about whether or not this candidate will be able to perform well at a client-facing job. Similarly, it will be possible to find whether the candidate is honestly replying to all the questions by measuring the change in emotions during his responses and correlating it the vast amount of knowledge available in this area.
3. Testing for Video Games - Facial emotion detection is a practical means of going beyond the spoken or written feedback and appreciating what the user is experiencing. When feedback is taken in this format, it becomes genuinely non-intrusive when it comes to user experience. At the same time, such feedback is more reliable than other forms.
